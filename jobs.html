                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                        Engine crews are the first to respond to local incidents on the Plumas National Forest and state-administered lands within Plumas County. Engine crews are available 7 days a week, staffed daily with a Captain, an Engine Operator, and three Firefighters. Engines crews are equipped to respond to all risk incidents, including wildland fires, vehicle accidents, structure fires, and search and rescues. The Beckwourth District engine crews are on a rotation for nationwide response to large incidents. National assignments, generally 14 days long, may be extended to up to 21 days, not including travel, with shift lengths of typically 16 hours a day.<br />
                        <br />
                        When not engaged in incident response, crews will work on training either in class or in the field through training. When crews are not training they may be completing project work, which consists of clearing vegetation / fuels reduction for prescribed fire or trail work, or performing station duties. Crew members are required to perform daily physical fitness training, which includes some form of aerobic or anaerobic exercise, full gear hikes, and weight training.<br />
                        <br />
                        The Beckwourth Ranger District staffs five Type III fire engines and one water tender. There are two engines at Frenchman Lake, one engine in Blairsden, one engine south of Lake Davis at Grizzly Station, and one engine at Doyle. For more information, contact the Captains of respective station, listed on the <a href="http://bkrdfiresuppression.com/contactus">contact page</a>.

                        Crews are truly the backbone to wildland fire suppression. Crews consist of 20 people who create a fireline to stop the forward progression of a fire. It takes a lot to be on a hotshot/hand crew. You'll need to be in great physical shape. You'll need to be a team player and work well with a lot of different personalities. Crews work best when they work together and have great cohesion. They work mostly with chainsaws and hand tools to clear vegetation for a fireline. They also work with a lot of heavy equipment and helicopters - takes a lot more experience and training, but they are willing to help you get there. One of a crew's ideals is that it takes a lot to be a good leader, but one must learn to be a good follower first.<br />
                        <br />
                        Crews can be expected to be gone all summer - they are a national resource and are always needed to fight wildland fires. Crews have been known to go anywhere from Alaska to Hawaii, and even internationally. They enjoy spiking out whenever possible. So you'll need to be prepared to not shower for 14 days and sleep in the dirt, but truthfully, that's kind of fun since it could be on top of a peak looking over a gorgeous mountain range, or in a beautiful meadow in the middle of nowhere. You never know where you'll be and what you'll see - its truly an experience of a lifetime.<br />
                        <br />
                        There are three crews on the Plumas National Forest; one on each district.  The crew for the Beckwourth District is based in the town of Beckwourth behind Nervino Airport. For more information, visit the <a href="http://bkrdfiresuppression.com/contactus">contact page</a>.

                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                        Lookouts are the first line of defense for fire suppression efforts.  Lookouts are staffed with a full-time lookout and a part-time lookout to cover days off.  The lookoutâ€™s job is to locate emerging fires and communicate fire information to the local dispatch center. They also communicate current weather to dispatch or help other resources locate fires on the district. Lookouts may host tower visitors or provide current and historic information to forest visitors. The job is solitary in nature, often going days on end without contact with people. The lookouts may be engaged in small repairs and maintenance of the lookout tower.<br />
                        <br />
                        Beckwourth Ranger District staffs three lookouts: Mills Peak, Smith Peak, and Dixie Mountain. Each tower is self-sufficient with a bedroom, kitchen, outhouse, telephone, and internet service. There is a graded road that allows for easy access to the tower. Although not required, the lookout assigned has historically lived at the tower. Weather can be cold and windy, and change suddenly at 7,000+ feet elevation.<br />
