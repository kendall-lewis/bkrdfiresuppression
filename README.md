## How to maintain / update this webpage

Every time a change is made to the site, or at the very least, to the content on this site, the date that appears in the footer for "last updated" should be changed to the current date.  To do this, open up the file `bkrdfiresuppression.js` within the `js` directory.  There is a variable called dateLastUpdated...modify the text to reflect the current date.  Then save and commit.  By changing it just in this file, the new date will be reflected in every page of the site.

Any other text you need to change, you will change within the respective file directly.  For example, when you're ready to add or change the accouncement numbers on the "How to Apply" page, you'll modify the file called `howtoapply.html`.

### Some notes

If you want to create new paragraphs within the text (i.e. within a `<p></p>` tag, or paragraph tag), you'll need to add a break (`<br />`).  This is the equivalent to hitting Enter several times like you might in a document or email, except that doing that here won't make it look any different.
