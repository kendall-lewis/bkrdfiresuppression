                    <p>
                        You must be at least 18 years old to apply.  You’ll also need some basic training, which you'd receive through classes.  Many community colleges offer such classes.  You should start with just the basics; you'll receive further training on the job and with experience.<br />
                        <br />
                        Basic Courses:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>I-100</li>
                        <li>IS-700</li>
                        <li>S-190</li>
                        <li>S-130</li>
                        <li>S-133</li>
                        <li>S-110</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><br />If you complete these classes, you’ll at least have your foot in the door.  However, before you go out and enroll in any of these classes, can you hack being a wildland firefighter?</p>

                    <p>This job is extremely physically and mentally demanding. You must be willing to go weeks without seeing family or friends. You will work long hours and may get little rest. Of course, you will see some of the most beautiful parts of America, and be paid for it, but this job isn’t for everyone.</p>

                        <br />
                        Project work may consist of using chainsaws and hand tools to clear vegetation out of an area or constructing handline for a prescribed fire. You could also be helping out other aspects of the Forest Service, including timber, range, and prevention.<br />
                        <br />
                        Wildland firefighters usually workout every day.  This physical training, or PT, can occur in the form of running, hiking, or other physical activities. Runs can range from a couple miles to five miles; hikes can be around the same distance.

                        Seasonal employment usually lasts from the beginning of May through October or November.<br />

                        <strong>Apprenticeship</strong><br />
                        Before applying for the apprenticeship, it is recommended that you first complete a season or two with an engine module or crew. The apprenticeship is a career-path oriented at promoting an individual to all aspects of fire suppression.

                        <li>Be sure that you have up-to-date contact information for all previous supervisors and put their contact info on the line after your work experience. If we are unable to verify your employment and obtain references, your application will not be considered.</li>
                        <li>References should be able to verify your employment, validate your experience, and provide insight into your work ethic, physical fitness, and attitude.</li>
                        <li>IN YOUR OWN WORDS provide a brief description of your present and previous positions, including non-fire jobs. List bullet points for your specific duties, accomplishments, and awards.</li>
                        <li>Include team sports, clubs, and extracurricular activities that show leadership and teamwork. List your exercise regimen.</li>
                        <li>Include any additional awards and specific accomplishments beyond those listed in your work experience.</li>
                        <li>List any additional applicable skills (e.g., chainsaw, welding, carpentry, computers, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Be sure to include all required documentation (an IQCS Master Record must be attached to your application unless you are applying for a GS-03 position).</li>
                        <li>Ensure you have the correct location checked on your online application.</li>
                        <li>DO NOT overstate your skill set. Employees are expected to live up to their resumes.</li>

                    <p>
                        Veterans are encouraged to apply. They are already familiar with the structure of the forest service since it is similar to the military.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Some tips:</strong>

                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Ensure you attach all applicable documents, including your DD-214, as requested.</li>
                        <li>It is understood that references may be currently deployed; try to provide alternative references of past supervisors. Contact the crew superintendent (add link to contact page) if you foresee any issues with your references.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that physical fitness expectations are quite a bit higher than those of the military. Please do not rely on successful completion of basic training as a measure of your physical fitness capability and compatibility with the crew.</li>
                        <li>If you need help with the application process, feel free to call the district office at (530) 836-2575, or stop by in-person.</li>
